			<p>As a consequence of the improvement of technology in the classroom, a global pandemic, changes in curriculums, and many other factors related to the transformation of secondary education, high schools in Pennsylvania have undergone significant changes over the past decade.<br><br>The total number of PA public high school graduates by demographic, along with their respective graduation rates, are recorded by the <a href="https://www.education.pa.gov/DataAndReporting/CohortGradRate/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Department of Education</a> each year. This report will address data findings and trends related to these datasets.

			<h3>More Students in Pennsylvania are graduating high school</h3>
			<p>Although total enrollment in Pennsylvania public high schools has decreased in the past 10 years, down about 7,500 students from the 2012-2013 school year, the percentage of students receiving their diploma out of their total cohort has slightly increased.<br><br>The overall graduation rate of Pennsylvania high school students peaked during the 2019-2020 academic year. This was the first school year affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, where students were forced to study from home during the final months of their last semester. The percent of students graduating was at its second highest number during the 2021-2022 school year; the last academic year recorded. These are the only two school years where the total graduation rate topped 87%.<br><br>"There was no issue with data collection because of the pandemic,” said Tim Wentz, educational statistician for the Pennsylvania Department of Education, when asked if there were any challenges prompted by COVID-19 and the switch to remote learning. “Students not being present in the classroom didn’t pose any problems, so we’re grateful that all the data came in.”<br><br>Certain demographics have seen a much higher increase in graduation rate than others. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students, although making up the smallest part of the total cohort for PA high schools, have had the largest rise in graduation rate, increasing 20%.<br><br>Multi-racial students have seen the lowest increase in graduation rate, only growing by 1%. No demographic has had a decrease in the percent of students that finish high school.</p><br>

			<p>According to the <a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/Education-details.aspx?newsid=1426" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Department of Education</a>, Increasing graduation rates are attributed partially to the improvement of standardized test scores across all subjects. In Pennsylvania, public school students are required to complete the <a href="https://www.education.pa.gov/K-12/Assessment%20and%20Accountability/Keystones/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Keystone Exams</a> at the end of every academic year to evaluate students' proficiency in Literature, Biology, and Algebra. The tests were implemented to replace PA schools' former standardized testing and to meet the obligations for the Every Student Succeeds Act, Signed by President Obama in 2015.<br><br>Researchers believe that there are a number of actions that the government and departments of education on both the state and federal levels can take to continue to increase graduation rates. As written in the <a href="https://alexwojcik22.github.io/Grad_Nation_2015_Report/18006_CE_BGN_Full_vFNL.pdf" target="_blank">"Building a Grad Nation" 2015 annual report</a>, the top policy recommendations include improving data reporting and fixing various classification issues such as who exactly is included in a cohort, making funding more equitable, especially for schools that educate high percentages of low-income students, reworking "counterproductive disciplinary policies", and standardizing diploma options for all students.

			<h3>Diversity is also up, but remains low</h3>
			<p>In the 2021-2022 academic year, there were about 90,000 white students enrolled in Pennsylvania high schools, making up nearly 66% of the total cohort for that year. This is a 6% decrease from 10 years ago, however white students still make up a significant majority of the PA high school students population.<br></p><br>

				<iframe title="Enrollment in PA Public Schools is Predominantly White" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-Ogfks" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ogfks/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 60% !important; padding: 8px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" height="405" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script><br>

			<p>On top of the increase in the percentage of non-white students in the total cohort, the graduation rate of non-white students in Pennsylvania also grew, increasing about 7% over the past 10 years.<br><br>Researchers have indicated that diversity in Pennsylvania schools can be promoted through an increase in non-white teachers. According to <a href="https://www.researchforaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RFA-TeacherDiversityinPennsylvania-Dec20.pdf" target="_blank">a study by Research for Action on teacher diversity in Pennsylvania</a>, published in December 2020, "there is a positive association between teachers of color and students of color in Pennsylvania schools" and the share of teachers of color has slightly increased since the 2013-2014 academic year.<br><br>Despite the known benefits of racial diversity among teaching staff, many PA schools have still failed to hire non-white teachers, as just over 1,000 PA public schools had zero teachers of color over the last seven school years. Within these schools, an average of 15% of the students were non-white. Research for Action asserts that increasing the number of teachers of color in the classroom is crucial for the improvement of equal educational opportunities in the classroom.</p>

			<h3>Going Forward and Improving</h3>
			<p>Continuing to increase many of the values included in this report, such as graduation rates and the percentage of students of color out of the total cohort, must be the top priority for Pennsylvania high schools.<br><br>In one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/learning/what-students-are-saying-about-how-to-improve-american-education.html" target="_blank">New York Times article</a>, U.S. students were interviewed and asked how American education can be improved. The responses included addressing the oversaturation of technology in the classroom, preparing students for the real world after graduating, increasing teacher pay, creating better learning environments, and other solutions related to increasing student engagement. These, on top of the solutions linked to data findings about PA high schools, should be considered by the Department of Education in the future for the purpose of maintaining positive trends in Pennsylvania public schools.<br><br>As mentioned in a previous section, the improvement of data collection must also be a primary consideration for the PA education system. Continuing to expand the demographics recorded as a part of the cohort graduation rate datasets, holding public charter, home, and alternative schools accountable for reporting their enrollment statistics, and maintaining accordance with federal and state accountability laws, such as the 2002 <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-107publ110/pdf/PLAW-107publ110.pdf" target="_blank">No Child Left Behind Act</a>, are essential to accurately representing student data in years to come.</p>
